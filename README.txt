v1.0.0 [2022/06/28] Finished first version
v1.1.0 [2022/08/19] Minor update:
  * Added section on frequently asked questions
  * Added '%!TEX root=../main.tex' as first line to chapters. This way one
  can start the compilation process in a chapter-file and the editor takes
  care of compiling the root file instead.
  * We now use the 'mathpazo' package to typeset both text and math using the
  wonderful Palatino font.
